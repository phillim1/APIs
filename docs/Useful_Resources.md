#### Tools

The [OpenAPI github
repo](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md)
provides a list of projects with implementation like editor, validator.

The OpenAPI Specification was originally known as Swagger, before being
contributed to the Open API Initiative.
[Swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) continues to support the community
with both free and commercial tooling. The [Swagger
Editor](https://editor.swagger.io//) is a web-based editor which can
assist with the initial authoring of APIs.

[Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle) is a
collection of OAS tools for .NET web APIs. Your service code can be
annotated to facilitate the generation of an OAS definition, and also to
generate the documentation on demand. This method of documentation can
be advantageous when it becomes difficult to keep the OAS definition in
sync with the code.
