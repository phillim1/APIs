This document is the **Finastra Open API Design Guide** and the intended audience are designers and developers of Finastra Open APIs.

This document introduces the concepts of Finastra RESTful Open APIs and details associated Finastra Open API development standards.

Designers and developers of Finastra Open APIs should read and understand the concepts and standards included in this guide before developing a Finastra API.
