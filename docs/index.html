This document is the **Finastra Open API Design Guide** and the intended audience are designers and developers of Finastra Open APIs.

This document introduces the concepts of Finastra RESTful Open APIs and details associated Finastra Open API development standards.

Designers and developers of Finastra Open APIs should read and understand the concepts and standards included in this guide before developing a Finastra API.

Finastra strategy is **API as a Product** and **API First** and these approaches will lead to successful implementation of a Finastra Open API as a product.

The Appendix of this document includes the following sections that are relevant to both novice and advanced designers and developers of Finastra APIs:

* a glossary of terms used in the document 
* a quick reference summary of Finastra Open API standards
